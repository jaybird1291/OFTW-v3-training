Analysis Results:
1. Suspicious execution chain  
  – 19:40:08 “Trading View” launched from /Volumes/Trading View (adhoc-signed, external volume)  
  – Immediately creates folder “521272586” under the user’s home and subdirs “Chromium”, “Chrome”  
  – Copies sensitive browser artefacts: Autofill0, Password1, Cookies2  
  – Spawns dscl (reads directory services), osascript, system_profiler (gathers system inventory)  
  – Writes “password-entered” and “login-keychain” files  
  – Zips the entire folder (ditto → 521272586.zip)  
  => Classic “stealer” behavior: harvest browser credentials, system info, keychain hints, bundle and prepare for exfiltration.  
2. Key artefacts to collect now  
  • /Volumes/Trading View/Trading View.app & associated helpers – check code signature, inspect binary for strings, sandbox escapes  
  • ~/521272586/ and ~/521272586.zip – exfiltrated payload, browser profiles, keychain dumps  
  • Chrome ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies, Login Data, Local State  
  • Firefox ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*.default*/cookies.sqlite, logins.json  
  • ~/Library/Keychains/login-keychain & password-entered file  
  • Shell history (~/.zsh_history) around 19:40:08  
  • /var/folders/*/T/com.apple.mobileassetd for MADAnalytics files  
  • /System/Library/AssetsV2/persisted/AutoControlManager & AutoAssetScheduler states  
  • TCC database (/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db) for unauthorized entries  
3. Recommended triage steps  
  a. Isolate the host (block further network egress)  
  b. Acquire a full disk image and live memory  
  c. Extract and inspect the “Trading View” binary with strings, lldb, Hopper/IDA  
  d. Decompress 521272586.zip, examine stolen data, check for exfil scripts or hardcoded C2  
  e. Audit browser extensions, check for malicious injected code or stolen session tokens  
  f. Review launchd, cron, LaunchAgents/Daemons for persistence plist entries (~/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchDaemons)  
  g. Check for unexpected network connections in /var/log/wifi.log, pf or firewall logs around 19:40  
  h. Search syslog and unified logs for any cs_invalidated, kextload, or tcc_modify events  
4. Investigation checklist  
  1. Collect disk image & memory  
  2. Extract and validate “Trading View” code signature; compute hash against known malware DBs  
  3. Parse shell history for subsequent exfil commands  
  4. Recover browser data stolen; identify what exactly was grabbed  
  5. Analyze mobileassetd & chronod writes (may reveal other asset downloads or tracking)  
  6. Dump TCC.db and check consent grants for osascript or system_profiler  
  7. Review network sessions (packet captures, proxy logs) for POST of 521272586.zip  
  8. Hunt for persistence: new plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, ~/Library/LaunchDaemons, /etc/cron*  
  9. Audit kext, kernel messages for cs_invalidated or kextload/unload around activity  
  10. Elevate case to IR team for full forensic and IOC rollout
